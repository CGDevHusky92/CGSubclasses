CGSubclasses
============

This is where I am starting to subclass different NS objects and extend them. Extensions and categories schemes will also be added when necessary. This gives the code base a much better cleaner set up. Contemplating converting everything into the specific extensions and just adding import to the prefix. Will play around with this later to see whats cleaner.
